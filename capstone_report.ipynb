Additionally, doing so would induce unnecessary competition. Like other business lines, she needs the least amount of competitiveness with a fair number of customers. To achieve the goal, it might not be a good idea to start a new yoga studio in the neighborhood with no yoga studio at all because it is possibly no demand in that location in the first place. The logical process may be clustering yoga studios and find the cluster with the least degree of competitiveness."

Everybody has to eat and more likely to try new food,  but not everybody is willing to practice yoga or even think of trying it. The logic of opening a restaurant is not the same as a yoga studio.\n",
    "Our passionate yoga should consider opening a new yoga studio in the same cluster area with the least competitivenessâ€”either cluster 1 in the same location as Lawrence Park and Thorncliffe Park or cluster 3 in the area around Central Bay Street and Stn A PO Boxes.\n"
